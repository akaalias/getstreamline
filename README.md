Hello and welcome! 

Alexis here. Great to have you. 

If you journal daily *and* take copious notes with Obsidian, maybe the following sounds familiar :)

## What I love

I LOVE journaling with pen and paper in the morning.

Journaling gives me a safe space where I let my heart speak. 

This makes me feel safe.

I also LOVE note-taking with Obsidian. 

It gives me an exciting space where let my mind wander.

That makes me feel like a million bucks.

## A FUCKING CONUNDRUM

But… 

Here’s the RUB.

### Problem #1: Peace without a future

When I journal with pen and paper, I often want to reference something I had written down. 

But there is **no easy way to link to a note** in Obsidian without losing the peace and quiet that I cherish. 

So, none of my heart-felt writings will be ever part of Obsidian because they’re stuck on paper???

Fuck.

### Problem #2: As exciting as pink noise

And when I write in Obsidian, it’s hard to focus. 

Either…

My **mind wanders off to far** by following one of the 6,018 rabbit-holes I’ve stored in my vault.

OR **my inner editor criticises my spelling** as I type, ensuring no creativity is left.

So, my notes in Obsidian will perpetually lack real depth and spontaneity that makes them sparkle???

FUCK!

## The freedom to be myself, connected

So I built Streamline.

It’s a *writer* that helps me:

**Enter** that quiet journaling space.

AND **Link** to my notes easily without getting pulled away.

AND **Let go** of my inner editor by removing most normal editor features.

### A new work-flow
Instead of journaling by hand, I now do a quick, relaxed Streamline session right after I log in to my laptop. 

The built-in search lets me insert links to Obsidian quickly. 

The save it as a markdown note to my vault.

It’s really simple.

It works. 

And it feels right.

So… If *you* struggle with what I’m talking about. 

Know that you’re NOT crazy and you’re NOT alone.

Streamline is free, so give it a spin!

## What you’ll get

### Learn to listen to your heart
If you’ve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that’s on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

With a bit of practice, you’ll be able to hear that quiet inner voice. 

You’ll see.

It’s really important stuff it has to say.

### Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It only moves *forward*. 

So, when you make a tYpO, there is no DELETE key. 

You can’t change the typo in that moment. 

That’s intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

With a little practice, you start to learn to accept those mistakes. 

You’ll start focusing on your flow instead.

(No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later.)

## What you’ll miss

Again, Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It only *moves forward*. 

- There is **no backspace** to delete
- There are **no paragraphs** to navigate
- There is **no markdown syntax** or highlighting
- There is **no copy-and-paste** or any other shortcuts

### How to link to your Obsidian vault
