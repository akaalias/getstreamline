Hi there, Alexis here. 

Great to have you. 

Here’s the conundrum I’ve struggled with. 

I love journaling in the morning with pen and paper because it’s a safe space where I can let my heart speak.

I also love digital note-taking with Obsidian because it’s an exciting space where I can let my mind wander.

But: 

When I journal with pen and paper, I often want to reference something I had written down. 

There is no good way to link to a note in Obsidian without losing the peace and quiet that I cherish. 

And when I write in Obsidian, either my mind wanders off too far or my inner editor starts criticizing my spelling as I type.

So I built Streamline to solve this conundrum.

It simply helps me:

- **Enter** that quiet journaling space 
- AND **Link** to my notes easily without getting pulled away
- AND **Let go** of my inner editor by removing most normal editor features

If *you* struggle with what I’m talking about, you’re not alone.

Streamline is free, so give it a spin!

## PS: What you’ll get

### 1. Learn to listen to your heart
If you’ve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that’s on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

### 2. Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer. It only moves *forward*. 

That means: When you make a mistake (like a typO), there is no DELETE key. You can’t change the typo in that moment. 

That’s intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later. 

Just learn to accept mistakes as you make them.
