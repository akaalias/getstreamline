### Tips and Tricks

### 1. Relax
If you’ve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that’s on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

### 2. Make mistakes
Streamline is a writer. It only moves *forward*. 

That means: When you make a mistake (like a typO), there is no DELETE key. You can’t change the typo in that moment. 

That’s intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later. 

Just learn to accept mistakes as you make them. 

### 3. Link profusely

The key reason why I built Streamline was that…

- It distracts me that when I try to write stream-of-consciousness with pen and paper I can’t link to a single note in my Obsidian vault
- It distracts me that when I try to write stream-of-consciousness with Obsidian, there are too many of my notes that pull me away.

So, Streamline gives me both: Easy access to my notes without the rabbit-holes.
