The key reason why I built Streamline was that **I get distracted**

- When I try to write stream-of-consciousness with pen and paper I, because **I can‚Äôt link to a single one of my 6018 Obsidian notes**
- When I try to write stream-of-consciousness with Obsidian, because **there are too many notes that pull me away**

## For Obsidian and Notion Writers:

Streamline helps you:

- **Enter** into a quiet and relaxed writing flow quicker.
- **Stay** in a quiet and relaxed writing flow longer.
- **Link** to more of your existing notes easily without getting pulled away.
- **Let go** of your inner critic by removing the option to correct in the first place

## What you get

### 1. Learn to listen to your heart
If you‚Äôve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that‚Äôs on your mind right now. 

Then another. 

And one more. 

The whole time, all you need to focus on is a single word! 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

### 2. Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer. It only moves *forward*. 

That means: When you make a mistake (like a typO), there is no DELETE key. You can‚Äôt change the typo in that moment. 

That‚Äôs intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later. 

Just learn to accept mistakes as you make them. 

### 3. Learn to link a lot

### **Link to your Obsidian notes**
- For quickly linking to your existing notes, select your Obsidian Vault via `Streamline -> Settings -> Obsidian Linking`

### **Link to your Notion pages**
- For quickly linking to your existing notes, select your Obsidian Vault via `Streamline -> Settings -> Notion Linking`
