## For Obsidian and Notion Writers:

Streamline helps you:

- Enter into your writing flow quicker.
- Stay in your writing flow longer.
- Connect more of your existing notes.
- Let go of your inner editor.

## What you get:
### 1. Learn to listen to your heart
If you‚Äôve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that‚Äôs on your mind right now. 

Then another. 

And one more. 

The whole time, all you need to focus on is a single word! 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

### 2. Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer. It only moves *forward*. 

That means: When you make a mistake (like a typO), there is no DELETE key. You can‚Äôt change the typo in that moment. 

That‚Äôs intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later. 

Just learn to accept mistakes as you make them. 

### 3. Learn to link a lot

The key reason why I built Streamline was that‚Ä¶

- It distracts me that when I try to write stream-of-consciousness with pen and paper I can‚Äôt link to a single note in my Obsidian vault
- It distracts me that when I try to write stream-of-consciousness with Obsidian, there are too many of my notes that pull me away.

So, Streamline gives me both: Easy access to my notes without the rabbit-holes.
