Hello and welcome! 

Alexis here. Great to have you. 

If you journal daily *and* take copious notes with Obsidian, maybe the following sounds familiar :)

## What I love

I LOVE journaling with pen and paper in the morning.

Journaling gives me a safe space where I let my heart speak. 

This makes me feel safe.

I also LOVE note-taking with Obsidian. 

It gives me an exciting space where let my mind wander.

That makes me feel like a million bucks.

## A FUCKING CONUNDRUM

But‚Ä¶ 

Here‚Äôs the RUB.

### Problem #1: Peace without a future

When I journal with pen and paper, I often want to reference something I had written down. 

But there is **no easy way to link to a note** in Obsidian without losing the peace and quiet that I cherish. 

So, none of my heart-felt writings will be ever part of Obsidian because they‚Äôre stuck on paper???

Fuck.

### Problem #2: As exciting as pink noise

And when I write in Obsidian, it‚Äôs hard to focus. 

Either‚Ä¶

My **mind wanders off to far** by following one of the 6,018 rabbit-holes I‚Äôve stored in my vault.

OR **my inner editor criticises my spelling** as I type, ensuring no creativity is left.

So, my notes in Obsidian will perpetually lack real depth and spontaneity that makes them sparkle???

FUCK!

## The freedom to be myself, connected

So I built Streamline.

It‚Äôs a *writer* that helps me:

**Enter** that quiet journaling space.

AND **Link** to my notes easily without getting pulled away.

AND **Let go** of my inner editor by removing most normal editor features.

### A new work-flow
Instead of journaling by hand, I now do a quick, relaxed Streamline session right after I log in to my laptop. 

The built-in search lets me insert links to Obsidian quickly. 

The save it as a markdown note to my vault.

It‚Äôs really simple.

It works. 

And it feels right.

‚Äî

So‚Ä¶ If *you* struggle with what I‚Äôm talking about. 

Know that you‚Äôre NOT crazy and you‚Äôre NOT alone.

Streamline is free, so give it a spin!

## What you‚Äôll get

### Learn to listen to your heart
If you‚Äôve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that‚Äôs on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

With a bit of practice, you‚Äôll be able to hear that quiet inner voice. 

You‚Äôll see.

It‚Äôs really important stuff it has to say.

### Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It only moves *forward*. 

So, when you make a tYpO, there is no DELETE key. 

You can‚Äôt change the typo in that moment. 

That‚Äôs intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

With a little practice, you start to learn to accept those mistakes. 

You‚Äôll start focusing on your flow instead.

(No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later.)

### Learn to link a lot

As you‚Äôre writing you can link to a note in Obsidian easily:

- **Enter** linking mode by typing `[[`
- **Exit** the linking mode with ESC
- **Choose** a link with your UP and DOWN arrow keys
- **Insert** the link into your stream with RETURN

## What you‚Äôll miss

Again, Streamline is a writer, not an editor. 

It intentionally only *moves forward*. 

- There is **no backspace** to delete a mistake
- There are **no paragraphs** to get off-track
- There is **no markdown syntax highlighting** to distract 
- There is **no copy-and-paste** or any other shortcuts
