Hello and welcome! 

Alexis here. Great to have you. 

If you’re an journaling/Obsidian fan, maybe this sounds familiar :)

I LOVE journaling with pen and paper in the morning. 

I gives me a safe space where I can *let* my heart speak.

I *also* LOVE note-taking with Obsidian. 

It gives me an exciting space where I can *let* my mind wander.

But… Here’s the CONUNDRUM I’ve struggled with. 

When I journal with pen and paper, I often want to reference something I had written down. 

There is no good way to link to a note in Obsidian without losing the peace and quiet that I cherish. 

So, NONE of my heart-felt and honest hand-written journaling notes will ever be part of my Obsidian ecosystem. 

Fuck.

And when I write in Obsidian, it’s hard to focus. 

Either my mind wanders off by following a link to a note I just created. 

OR my *inner editor* starts criticising my spelling as I type.

So, my notes in Obsidian will perpetually lack a real depth and the creative roughness that would make them mine.

FUCK!

—

So I built Streamline.

It simply helps me:

- **Enter** that quiet journaling space 
- AND **Link** to my notes easily without getting pulled away
- AND **Let go** of my inner editor by removing most normal editor features

If *you* struggle with what I’m talking about, you’re not alone.

Streamline is free, so give it a spin!

## PS: What you’ll get

### 1. Learn to listen to your heart
If you’ve never done stream-of-consciousness writing before, it can seem daunting and confusing. 

All you need to do is write one word that’s on your mind right now. 

There is no hurry. You can type as slow or fast as you like. 

### 2. Learn to love your mistakes
Streamline is a writer. It only moves *forward*. 

That means: When you make a mistake (like a typO), there is no DELETE key. You can’t change the typo in that moment. 

That’s intentional as it teaches you to continue moving forward regardless. 

No worries, you can save your writing to markdown and give it the old editor treatment later. 

Just learn to accept mistakes as you make them.
