			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Do I need to sign-up before I can give it a spin?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					No! There's no sign-up required. Streamline is completely self-contained and works right out the box.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Are there any in-app purchases to “unlock” the full version?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Nope. What you see in terms of features is what you get. In fact, both, <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/getstreamline" target="_blank">this site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/Streamline" target="_blank">the application</a> are free and open-source software! Yay!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Is this app sending any sort of tracking/user-analytics events?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Nope. No tracking/analytics installed and not planning to.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Why is this a native app and not an Obsidian plugin?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Great question! I tried that. Obsidian simply is too distracting for me to get lost in a rabbithole (I think that's one of its strengths actually).
					Having a stand-alone app helps me immerse myself.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Are you suggesting that I should use Streamline <b>instead</b> of Obsidian or my pen-and-paper notebook?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Not at all. I use Streamline usually in the morning <i>before</i> I open Obsidian. I use it alongside <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>, too. So, think "and" not "or".
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">I use Notion, not Obsidian. Can I use it still?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Yes! There is a small hack to get auto-complete working. <a href="https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/lets-talk">Ping me and I'll show you!</a>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Is this <i>yet another </i> super slick mIniMaLiSt mArkDOwn tExt eDiTor?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					No. And I know exactly what you mean. NO ONE needs another one of those.
					Aside from semantics ("Streamline is a <i>writer</i>, not an <i>editor</i>."),
					it's stripped-down, not minimalist. It barely has three features out of my own, <a href="http://www.secretsofstory.com/2012/11/storytellers-rulebook-164-ideas-are.html" target="_blank">honest, painful necessity</a>.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">Does this app send my text into the cloud for analysis?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					Nope. All writing and saving is done locally. In fact, the app is fully functional, even without internet access. You could be offline and still write and save.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">What is the app "made" of?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					It’s <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/Streamline" target="_blank">written</a> in Swift and Objective-C.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="qa">
				<h3 class="question-q">If it's soOoO cOoL, then WHY ON EARTH are you giving it away?</h3>
				<p class="answer">
					It's a personal project that I built for myself. It solves a real pain-point with Obsidian that I repeatedly noticed in my life. If you experience the struggle, I hope it helps you as well as it has helped me!
				</p>
